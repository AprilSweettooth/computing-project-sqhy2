# Zoo

This is the zoo for lenia with varies creature's inital array layout as well as their parameters in json file

The remaining creatures falls in two categories: 
1. for demonstration of FFT algorithm speed comparison 
2. for stepsize change experiments and the second case needs library function to load the parameters

        - Note there is a file called encyclopedia.json which contains all creatures from Bert Chan's github library and we can take out parameters of any creature inside with restore.py in utils
